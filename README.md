# Swift — Solving Trivia

## Objectives

1. Write a function that uses control flow statements.

## Instructions

Open the `swift-solving-trivia.xcworkspace` and navigate to the `AppDelegate.swift` file. You will need to declare one function in order to get the test to build (`⌘` `U`).

Declare a function named `solvingTrivia()` that takes one argument, a dictionary containing key-value pairs of strings, and returns a string. Write its implementation so that it provides a string containing the answer to the following trivia question:

**What is the only state whose capital contains none of the characters as the state name?**  
Example: Alaska __is not__ the answer because Juneau and Alaska both contain an A.

##### Hints:
*Is there a way to split a string into characters?*  
*Does your comparison need to be case insensitive?*
